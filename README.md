# SignUpForm
In this repo I am going to create a sign up form using HTML , CSS and JS


# what I have learned so far , I have to revist this and will make necessary changes in future

#1 I have learnt that I have to plan the structure of html according to the requirement 
#2 divide the logic into pieces and combine them to get what is required
#3 regular expressions in javascript
